        <h2>Verse One</h2>
        <p>
            One thousand pink balloons<br />
            DJ with your favorite tunes<br />
            Birthday cake in August<br />
            But you were born 19th of June<br />
            Champagne pourin' in your mouth<br />
            Called your friends from out of town<br />
            Got the party bag with the purple pills<br />
            And I'm waiting for you by the window, yeah<br />
            Called your digits, but the phone kept ringin'<br />
            Wish I knew what you were thinking<br />
            Na-na-na<br />
            One thousand pink balloons<br />
            Dancin' on to your favorite tunes<br />
            Hope you walk in the party<br />
            'Cause I threw the party just for you, like woah<br />
        </p>

        <h2>Verse Two</h2>
        <p>
            You could watch me pull up on your body<br />
            Like it's summer, take my clothes off<br />
            In the water, splash around and get you blessed by holy water<br />
            I don't know what you were waiting for<br />
            You know that I've been waiting for you (<i>I only threw this party for you!</i>)<br />
            Yeah, if you saw my tears, would you touch me?<br />
            Kiss me on the mouth, say you love me?<br />
            Leave a message, tell me you're sorry?<br />
            Hit me right back, hit me right back (<i>Why you treating me like someone that you never loved?</i>)<br />
        </p>
