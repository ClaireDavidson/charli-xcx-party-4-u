        <h2>Charli XCX, On the Song's Resurgence</h2>
        <p>Though "Party 4 U" was a fan favorite deep cut upon the release of <i>how i'm feeling now</i>, it wasn't until 2025 that the song began to experience mainstream traction. "Party 4 U" began to truly make waves as the result of a TikTok challenge that saw users lip-syncing to the song's rapped second verse, a reference to a similar moment on the television show <i>RuPaul's Drag Race</i> that involved a contestant's performance of the Paula Abdul song "Cold Hearted." (Charli herself <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@charlixcx/video/7471302687632461078">participated</a> in the trend.)</p> 
        <p>In mid-February of 2025, the song debuted at #80 on the U.S. Spotify Viral 100 chart, the highest entry of that week. Charli had this to say in response to the news:</p>
        <blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">it’s p crazy that this song is suddenly getting love in this kinda way. i know this song means so much to so many angels. she’s a cutie &lt;3 <a href="https://t.co/8YRx2pAQ95">https://t.co/8YRx2pAQ95</a></p>&mdash; Charli (@charli_xcx) <a href="https://twitter.com/charli_xcx/status/1892316065654280249?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 19, 2025</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
        <p>(Charli's use of the term "Angels" refers to her fanbase—literally, Charli's Angels.)</p>
        <p>The song itself had a long gestation period: initially written in 2017, "Party 4 U" was intended for Charli XCX's mixtape <i>Pop 2</i>. While the track was shelved for the time being, Charli would frequently include it in live performances, where it would become a cult favorite among diehard fans. That it would eventually see a formal release on <i>how i'm feeling now</i> fits the album's ethos well, as it was borne of Charli's decision to directly collaborate with fans on the album's visuals and sonic direction.</p>

        <h2>On the Song's Resonance as a Pandemic Anthem</h2>

        <p>"Even the simplistic premise of 'party 4 u' takes on new meaning under the circumstances: 'I only threw this party for you/For you, for you, for you.' Hey, it’s not like anybody else can come.</p>
        <p>The sentiments read simply, but with the collective fear and uncertainty of pandemic still surrounding us, their meaning feels profound. As Pitchfork contributor Shaad D’Souza <a href="https://www.papermag.com/charli-xcx-how-im-feeling-now-future-pop-2646006658.html">wrote</a> last week, Charli’s music is not the pop of the future, but a pure expression of the present. By design, <i>How I’m Feeling Now</i> is so current that it’s hard to imagine its message resonating the same way when life begins to feel normal once again. It’s a cultural artifact from the ultimate liminal space, between the old, pre-pandemic world and an uncertain new landscape—why should it live anywhere else?"</p>

        <h2>On the Intense Reactions the Song Has Inspired in Fans</h2>

        <p>"'This sounds EXACTLY like when you realise they will never again be the person you first met and there’s nothing you can do about it,' <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@yoitsmegeorgie/video/7495306329540529416">TikToker Georgie Hansen</a> wrote in a post accompanied by [a] clip of the song. <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@_poppys_iphone/video/7495073559694593302">Another creator named Poppy</a> said, 'this part of the song is going to bathroom mid-party and becoming conscious that ur acting like a completely different person.' And yet another take from <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@tylerdevinee/video/7495330006613232918">musician Tyler Devine</a> claimed, 'you’re all wrong. this song is crying in the club. it’s seeing the person u like kiss someone else. it’s the uber home alone.'"</p>
